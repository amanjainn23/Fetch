Subject: Data Quality Assessment and Warehouse Model Proposal

Hi team,
I've completed the initial analysis of our receipts, users, and brands data sets. I wanted to share some key findings and get your input on a few items.
Key Findings:

Data Model Improvements

Proposed a normalized structure that separates receipt items into their own table
Added proper foreign key relationships to improve data integrity
Created a separate CPG dimension table to better handle brand hierarchies


Data Quality Concerns

Found inconsistencies in date fields (scan dates before purchase dates)
Identified mismatches between item counts and actual items in receipts
Discovered some referential integrity issues with brand IDs
Noticed some unusual patterns in points allocation



Questions and Recommendations:

Data Validation Requirements

Do we have business rules for the minimum time between purchase and scan dates?
Should we implement automatic validation for point calculations?
What's the expected behavior for receipt status transitions?


Performance Considerations

Planning to implement partitioning on the receipts table by scan date
Recommending appropriate indexes on frequently joined columns
Suggesting materialized views for common brand analytics queries


Data Enrichment Opportunities

Could we enhance the brand categorization structure?
Would adding geographic clustering improve analysis capabilities?
Should we maintain historical points calculation rules?



Next Steps:

Would love to schedule a brief meeting to discuss these findings
Need clarification on business rules for data validation
Would like to review the proposed indexing strategy with the engineering team

Please let me know your thoughts and when would be a good time to discuss these items in detail.

Best regards,
